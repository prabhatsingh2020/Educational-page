            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit
                purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with
                classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most
                school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that
                system. Such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces
                (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational
                activities, and more.
